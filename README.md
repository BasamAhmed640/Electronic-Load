# Electronic-Load-Turbine-Control
System Performance & Capabilities

This system is engineered as a high-fidelity instrument for the complete characterization and optimization of wind turbine generators. Its performance is defined by its precision, stability, and intelligent control algorithms.
Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Performance

Tracking Efficiency: The Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm consistently locates and tracks the generator's true Maximum Power Point (MPP)

Dynamic Response: The system actively adapts the load in real-time to maximize energy extraction under changing wind conditions, ensuring the turbine is always operating at its peak potential.

Electronic Load Performance

High-Resolution Control: Achieves a current draw resolution of 0.8 mA, enabling the generation of extremely detailed I-V and P-V curves with thousands of data points for high-fidelity generator characterization.

Load Stability: In Constant Current (CC) mode, the system maintains a stability of Â±1.5 mA from the setpoint, even with fluctuating input voltages, demonstrating the robustness of the analog feedback loop.

Dual-Mode Functionality: Provides both Constant Current (CC) and Constant Resistance (CR) modes, offering the flexibility required for a full range of power electronics testing and analysis.

Hardware & Signal Integrity

Measurement Accuracy: All performance metrics are built upon the precision of a 16-bit ADC for sensing and a 12-bit DAC for control, minimizing measurement noise and control error.

Signal Reliability: The custom 4-layer PCB, designed in Altium Designer, provides excellent noise immunity and signal integrity, ensuring that all measurements are repeatable and reliable for R&D applications.
