# Electronic-Load
This system is engineered as a high-fidelity instrument for the complete characterization and performance validation of various power sources. Its capabilities are defined by its precision, stability, and intelligent control algorithms for both static and dynamic testing.
Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Functionality

    Tracking Efficiency: The Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm consistently locates and tracks the connected source's true Maximum Power Point (MPP), making it an ideal tool for optimizing solar cells, thermoelectric generators, and other variable power sources.

    Dynamic Response: The system actively adapts its load in real-time to maximize energy extraction under dynamic operating conditions, ensuring the device under test is always operating at its peak potential.

Core Load Performance & Precision

    High-Resolution Control: Achieves a current draw resolution of 0.8 mA, enabling the generation of extremely detailed I-V and P-V curves with thousands of data points for high-fidelity power source characterization.

    Dual-Mode Functionality: Provides both Constant Current (CC) and Constant Resistance (CR) modes, offering the flexibility required for a full range of power electronics testing, battery discharge profiling, and power supply analysis.

Hardware & Signal Integrity

    Measurement Accuracy: System precision is built upon a 16-bit ADC for high-resolution sensing and a 12-bit DAC for fine control, minimizing measurement noise and control error.

    Signal Reliability: The custom 4-layer PCB, designed in Altium Designer, provides excellent noise immunity and signal integrity, ensuring that all measurements are repeatable and reliable for demanding R&D applications.
